### Project Directories:

1. **cell-growth-data-OD600-measurements:**
   - Contains yeast cell growth data using OD600 measurements under NaCl stress conditions.

2. **cell-stimulation-profiles:**
   - Contains MATLAB codes to generate gradual stress profiles (subdirectory: `GeneratingPumpProfiles`).
   - Includes the generated PPL files for gradual stress profiles, suitable for programming syringe pumps (subdirectory: `stress-profiles-PPL-files`).

3. **cell-volume-signaling-data:**
   - Contains data for yeast cell volume change and Hog1 nuclear localization over time under gradual stress conditions.

4. **matlab-general-functions:**
   - Houses general MATLAB functions crucial for running the codes in Figure02 to Figure06, facilitating data analysis and figure generation.
