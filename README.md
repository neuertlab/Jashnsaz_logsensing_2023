### Project Directories:

Directory: `data` contains the following: 
1. **cell-growth-data-OD600-measurements:**
   - yeast cell growth data using OD600 measurements under NaCl stress conditions.

2. **cell-stimulation-profiles:**
   - MATLAB codes to generate gradual stress profiles.
   - The generated PPL files for gradual stress profiles, suitable for programming syringe pumps.

3. **cell-volume-signaling-data:**
   - data for yeast cells volume change and Hog1 nuclear localization over time under gradual stress conditions.

4. **matlab-general-functions:**
   - general MATLAB functions crucial for running the codes in Figure02 to Figure06, facilitating data analysis and figure generation.

Directories `Figure01` to `Figure07` contains the corresponding figures and MATALB analysis codes. These codes are generated in MATLAB R2021a.
