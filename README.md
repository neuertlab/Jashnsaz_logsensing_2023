**Summary**
How cells respond to dynamic environmental changes is crucial for understanding fundamental biological processes and cell physiology. In this study, we developed an experimental and quantitative analytical framework to explore how dynamic stress gradients that change over time regulate cellular volume, signaling activation, and growth phenotypes. Our findings reveal that gradual stress conditions substantially enhance cell growth compared to conventional acute stress. This growth advantage correlates with a minimal reduction in cell volume dependent on the dynamic of stress. We explain the growth phenotype with our finding of a logarithmic signal transduction mechanism in the yeast Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) osmotic stress response pathway. These insights into the interplay between gradual environments, cell volume change, dynamic cell signaling, and growth, advance our understanding of fundamental cellular processes in gradual stress environments.
